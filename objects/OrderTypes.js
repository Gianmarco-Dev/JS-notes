// Create an enumeration like CARD_SUITS above. 
// Our enumeration will be named ORDER_TYPES and describe the different types of orders that are possible in our system.

const ORDER_TYPES = {
    PIZZA: 0,
    PASTA: 1,
    SALAD: 2,
  };
  
  export default ORDER_TYPES;


//   In this example, we define an ORDER_TYPES object with three keys: PIZZA, PASTA, and SALAD. 
//   The values of these keys are numeric, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each additional key. 
//   You can add more order types as necessary, following the same pattern.

//  This enumeration can be used in the code to provide a standardized way of referring to different types of orders, which can help make your code more readable and maintainable.
